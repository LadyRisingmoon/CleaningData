Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data 

Instructions
---------------------------------------

Create R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
<p> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. </p> 
<p> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </p> 
<p> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. </p>  
<p> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. </p>  
<p> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. </p> 

<p> Background </p>
----------------------------------------

<p> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  </p>

<p> R-Code explanation </p>
---------------------------------------
<p> Install addition required packages  </p>
<p> Read the test and training data into R </p>
<p> Read the test and training data labels into R </p>
<p> Label the data frames </p>
<p> Subset the data so that only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement remain </p>
<p> Create the first dataframe by joining the test data </p>
<p> Create the second dataframe by joining the training data </p>
<p> Merge the test and training data </p>
<p> Create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject </p>
<p> Create a txt file of tidy.data created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE </p>
